        P-controller for current regulation with manual/auto mode switching.
        Control loop runs at 1 kHz (1ms interval) and supports:
        - MANUAL mode: Direct PWM control
        - AUTO mode: Automatic P-control based on ADC feedback

        Formula: PWM = feed_forward + (Kp * (setpoint - measured)) / 100
